## Project Overview üîç
This is a fun and practical machine learning project designed to detect theft using computer vision and anomaly detection techniques. The system processes video footage, identifies suspicious activity, and alerts users when potential theft is detected. This project is ideal for exploring security applications in AI.

## Features
- Real-time theft detection using video analysis
- Object tracking and motion detection
- Anomaly detection to flag unusual behavior
- Customizable sensitivity settings

## Technologies Used
- **Python** üêç
- **OpenCV** for video processing
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning-based anomaly detection
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling

## How to Use
1. Open the project in Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies if needed (`pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy pandas`).
3. Upload a video or use a live camera feed.
4. Run the script to analyze the footage for theft detection.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing model accuracy with more training data.
- Integrating an alert system for real-time notifications.
- Implementing multi-camera support for wider coverage.

This project is a great way to explore AI-powered security systems.üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
